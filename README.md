## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Using flexbox could get tiring, especially when creating complex grid sections. In this challenge, I learnt how to create multiple flex containers and manage their complexity, rather than using css grid

```html
<div class="parent_container">
        <!-- sub parent container -->
        <div class="sub_parent_container">
        <!-- first child container -->
        <div class="child_container_one">
```
```css
sub_parent_container{
        display:flex;
    }
```
